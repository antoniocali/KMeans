# KMeans
First python Project.
Try to create a k-Means clustering in Python.

Working on.
Actually it just ask for number of points and number of cluster and it creates cluster in right way.
Added graphics - it shows cluster in canvas

## TO DO
* Step 0 is configured in right way? (Do you like your first centroid?)
* Add a way to create point with different probability distribution (not just a randint(10))
